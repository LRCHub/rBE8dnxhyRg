Southern California is bad for the soul
And New York City takes its toll
The Mississippi River has a mean undertow
How can I shield myself from the things that I hear
I want to close my eyes and sleep for a year
Tell me that it's only a dream
That it's a nightmare
Trying not to think about it
Trying not to think about it
How can your mother be so strong
When her only baby is gone
I don't know where you are
Everything is wrong
So I'm trying not to think about it
