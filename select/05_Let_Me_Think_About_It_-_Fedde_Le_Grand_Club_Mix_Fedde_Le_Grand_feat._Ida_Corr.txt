Let me think about it
Let me think about it

You saying, "Baby, I'll take you for a ride"
Let's get together, work it all night
I'll be your lover, your sexy affair
I'll make you feel like heaven is near

Let me think about it
Let me think about it

Come on girl, believe me, I'll make you see
That I am the true way to ecstasy
Touch me, feel me, then you will find
We are meant to be and I ain't lying

Let me think about it
Let me think about it

Can I get with you, baby?
Blow your mind or whatever you like
Think about it
You don't have to think no more
Baby, come on
Cute as the sun, cute as the sun
Cute as the sun, let's go

Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it

You say you want me
You say you need me
You say you love me
I can't believe it

Let me think about it
Baby, think about it
Let me think about it
Baby, think about it

Let me think about it
Baby, think about it
Let me think about it
Baby, think about it

Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it

Let me think about it
